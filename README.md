# Panadestein's CV

Welcome to the repository where I keep my academic CV and industry resume!

This repo is for everyone interested in my professional background and experiences. Both documents are written in LaTeX, which allows for a clean, professional look and easy customization.

For more about me, my experiences, and my projects, please visit my personal website at [https://panadestein.github.io/](https://panadestein.github.io/).
